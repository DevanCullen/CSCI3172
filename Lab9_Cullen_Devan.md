- <!---How---> The code in [YariPL](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/arr-sort-a-b-a-b-explanation/167677)  was implemented by using .sort function.

- <!---Why---> [YariPL](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/arr-sort-a-b-a-b-explanation/167677) Code was used because it sorts numbers for median.
- <!---How---> [Jose Soncco]YariPL](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/arr-sort-a-b-a-b-explanation/167677) Code was modified by using it for finding the median of the input numbers.
